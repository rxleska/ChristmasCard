# ChristmasCard
 This is a christmas themed clicker game based upon cookie clicker made for my AP 
 computer science class, The goal is to create enough snow to close school, to do 
 this you and your friends are making snow. As the saying says 'you need to spend 
 money to make money', spend snow flakes to increase your rate of snow making.
  ENJOY,
